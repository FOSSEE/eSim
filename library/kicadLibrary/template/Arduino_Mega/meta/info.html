    <h1>Arduino Mega Shield</h1>
    
    <p>
      This project template is the basis of an expansion board for the <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/mega-2560-r3">Arduino Mega 2560</a>. It includes a PCB edge matching the outline of the Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3 PCB with connectors and mounting holes placed correctly to align the two boards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: due to the fact that the official 3D library does not include "long" or "stacking" female headers, the default Connector_PinSocket_2.54mm models were used.
