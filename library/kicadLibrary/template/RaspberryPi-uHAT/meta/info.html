    <h1>Raspberry Pi uHAT</h1>
    <h2>Reduced Form Factor 40-pin Expansion Board</h2>

    <p>
      This project template forms the basis of an expansion board (HAT) for the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="blank">Raspberry Pi</a> single board computers with a 40-pin GPIO header.
      <br>
      This includes the following models:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Pi Zero</li>
        <li>Pi Zero W</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      This project includes a PCB edge set according to the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypi/hats/master/uhat-board-mechanical.pdf">Raspberry Pi uHAT Mechanical Specification</a> with connectors placed correctly to align the two boards. An alternate edge is included on the User.Drawings layer for the use with an SMT connector.
    </p>

    <p>
      The schematic includes an ID EEPROM chip along with the necessary support components. It <em>does not</em> specify footprints for the ID EEPROM. It is up to the user to choose an appropriate EEPROM chip and footprints.
    </p>

    <p>
      Te official <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats">Raspberry Pi HAT Specification</a> includes additional information and a design guide.
