This ensures your setup, libraries, and tools like Ngspice and KiCad are working correctly."
"Why are component libraries not showing up in KiCad after installing eSim?","Component libraries may not load due to incorrect library paths. Open KiCad and navigate to Preferences > Manage Symbol Libraries. Ensure that the FOSSEE component libraries are listed and correctly linked to their directory. You can re-run the configuration script provided during eSim setup to auto-link libraries."
"Simulation is not running even after creating the netlist. What could be the issue?","Common reasons include missing power or ground connections, open circuits, unrecognized components, or syntax errors in the schematic. Double-check all component connections and labels. After conversion, open the generated netlist to inspect for any errors or warnings before simulation."
"Where are the eSim project files saved on my system?","By default, eSim saves project files in your home directory under a folder named 'eSim' or 'Projects'. However, during project creation, you can select a custom location. Each project folder contains schematic files, netlists, simulation data, and configuration files necessary for your work."
"How do I update eSim to the latest version?","Visit the official eSim website and download the latest version for your operating system. On Linux systems, you can remove the old version and install the new one using updated shell scripts or `.deb` packages. Make sure to backup your existing project files before updating to prevent data loss."
"I'm getting 'permission denied' errors while running eSim. What should I do?","This usually occurs when eSim is installed in a directory requiring elevated permissions, or when user privileges are insufficient. Avoid running eSim as root. Ensure the install directory and all project files have appropriate read/write permissions for your user account using commands like `chmod` or `chown` on Linux."
"Can I import old KiCad projects into eSim after installation?","Yes. You can import existing KiCad schematics into eSim by creating a new eSim project and selecting the KiCad `.sch` file. Then use the 'Convert KiCad to Ngspice' feature to generate a netlist and simulate your circuit. Ensure your schematic uses supported components and proper wiring conventions."
"How do I configure eSim after installation?","After installation, you may need to configure library paths, simulation settings, and environment variables. Open eSim, go to the preferences/settings menu, and specify paths for KiCad, Ngspice, and user libraries if needed. On Linux, you can also run post-install configuration scripts to automate this setup."
"Is there a sample project I can use to test eSim after installation?","Yes, the eSim website and documentation provide multiple sample projects. These include basic analog and digital circuits that you can open, simulate, and analyze. Running these helps validate that your installation, component libraries, and simulation engine are functioning correctly."
"eSim GUI is slow or unresponsive. How can I fix this?","Performance issues may stem from high system load, insufficient RAM, or GPU driver problems. Close other heavy applications, update your graphics drivers, and ensure your system meets the minimum requirements. On Linux, running eSim on a lightweight desktop environment like XFCE or LXDE can also improve responsiveness."
"How do I uninstall eSim if I face repeated issues?","On Linux, if installed via a `.deb` package, you can uninstall using `sudo apt remove esim`. If installed manually, delete the eSim directory and associated configuration files. For Windows and macOS, use the standard uninstall methods or run the provided uninstaller if available. Always back up projects before uninstalling."
"Can I use eSim offline after installation?","Yes, once installed, eSim works fully offline. All core features like schematic design, simulation, netlist generation, and waveform viewing are available without an internet connection. However, for documentation or community support, you may need internet access occasionally."
"How do I add custom component models to eSim?","To add custom components, place your SPICE model files (.lib or .mod) in the eSim library directory, typically located in the installation folder under 'library/deviceModelLibrary'. Then update the component library in KiCad by editing the symbol libraries and associating your custom symbols with the SPICE models. Restart eSim to recognize new components."
"Why is my simulation taking too long to complete?","Long simulation times can result from small time steps, large simulation duration, or complex circuits with many nodes. Try increasing the time step in simulation parameters, reducing the total simulation time, or simplifying your circuit. For transient analysis, consider using appropriate initial conditions to speed up convergence."
"How do I export simulation results from eSim?","Simulation results can be exported from the waveform viewer by right-clicking on the plot and selecting export options. You can save waveforms as CSV files, images (PNG/SVG), or copy data to clipboard. For batch processing, results are also saved automatically in the project directory as text files."
"What should I do if components are missing from the eSim library?","If required components are missing, you can download additional SPICE models from component manufacturers or online databases. Place these models in the appropriate library folders and create corresponding symbols in KiCad. Alternatively, you can use equivalent components or create subcircuit models using basic elements."
"How do I perform AC analysis in eSim?","For AC analysis, ensure your circuit has an AC voltage source. In the simulation setup, select 'AC Analysis' and specify the frequency range (start, stop) and type (decade, linear, or octave). Set the number of points per decade/octave. After running simulation, view frequency response plots in the waveform viewer to analyze gain, phase, and other AC characteristics."
"Can I simulate digital circuits in eSim?","Yes, eSim supports mixed-signal simulation through Ngspice. You can use digital components from the library or create digital subcircuits. For pure digital simulation, consider using behavioral models or Verilog-A models. Mixed analog-digital circuits require proper interfacing between analog and digital domains using appropriate bridge elements."
"How do I troubleshoot convergence errors in simulation?","Convergence errors often occur due to unrealistic initial conditions, stiff circuits, or inappropriate component values. Try setting initial conditions for capacitors and inductors, use smaller time steps, adjust simulation tolerances in Ngspice options, or add small resistances to floating nodes. Check for feedback loops without proper compensation."
"What file formats does eSim support for import/export?","eSim primarily works with KiCad schematic files (.sch), Ngspice netlists (.cir), and SPICE model files (.lib, .mod). It can export simulation results as CSV, text files, and images. For PCB design, it integrates with KiCad's PCB editor supporting standard formats like Gerber files for manufacturing."
"How do I set up parametric analysis in eSim?","Parametric analysis in eSim allows you to vary the value of a component (like a resistor or voltage source) over a defined range to observe its impact on circuit behavior. To set it up, first create your circuit, then define the parameter using the 'Parameters' option and configure the analysis settings in the simulation control panel."
