History and Evolution of eSim
================================

eSim is an open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool developed by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay, with the goal of making circuit design and simulation accessible to students, educators, and professionals across the globe.

Origins and Motivation
--------------------------
eSim was conceived to provide a free and open-source alternative to proprietary EDA tools, enabling academic institutions and individuals to teach, learn, and innovate without licensing barriers. The project began as an initiative to localize and enhance the capabilities of existing open-source tools, integrating them into a unified platform.

Major Milestones
--------------------
- **2012-2014:** Project inception and initial development, focusing on schematic capture and simulation, the project was then known as Osdag initially and later in 2015 renamed as eSim.
- **2016:** First public release, featuring a user-friendly interface and support for basic analog simulation using kicad and ngspice.
- **2018:** Introduction of advanced features such as digital simulation, model generation, and library converters along with mixed-signal simulation support using NGHDL.
- **2020-2021:** Enhanced interoperability with popular EDA tools like LTspice and PSpice, interface with makerchip and improved documentation.
- **2022:** Launch of the Maker module, enabling project management, digital design, and Modelica integration.
- **2024:** Ongoing improvements, community contributions, and support for new simulation engines and workflows.

Community and Impact
--------------------------
eSim has grown into a vibrant community-driven project, with contributions from students, educators, and industry professionals. It is widely adopted in academic curricula and has empowered thousands of users to design and simulate electronic circuits efficiently.

Looking Ahead
-----------------
The eSim project continues to evolve, with a focus on expanding features, enhancing usability, and fostering collaboration. The development team welcomes feedback, contributions, and new ideas from the global electronics community.
