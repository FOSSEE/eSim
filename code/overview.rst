Overview
==============

Welcome to eSim!
----------------

**eSim** is an **open-source** Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool developed by **FOSSEE, IIT Bombay**, with the goal of making circuit design and simulation accessible to students, educators, and professionals across the globe.

This documentation is designed for both users who want to design and simulate circuits with eSim, and for developers interested in contributing to the eSim codebase.

About the Documentation
------------------------------
The documentation is divided into two main sections:

1. **Getting Started:**  
   Learn how to install eSim and get up and running quickly. This section covers the introduction to eSim and the installation guide.

2. **Components:**  
   Dive deep into the eSim codebase. This section explains each module, file, and method, helping developers and advanced users understand and extend eSim.
