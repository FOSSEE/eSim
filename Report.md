# Task 2 ‚Äì eSim Upgradation (Ubuntu 23.04 Compatibility Fix)

## ‚ùå Problem Statement:
eSim (Electronics Simulation Software), developed by FOSSEE, has installation issues on **Ubuntu 23.04**. The main reason for the failure is that the **`llvm-9`** and **`llvm-9-dev`** packages‚Äîrequired by NGHDL and GHDL‚Äîare no longer available in the official Ubuntu repositories. The `nghdl-install.sh` and `eSim-install.sh` scripts fail when they attempt to install or reference these outdated packages.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Overview:
To ensure successful installation and execution of eSim on Ubuntu 23.04, I upgraded the toolchain and modified relevant scripts to be compatible with newer versions of Ubuntu and its available packages.

---

## üîÅ Step-by-Step Work Done:

### üß© Step 1: Initial Problem Analysis
- Cloned the original eSim repository and ran `install-eSim.sh`.
- Faced error due to missing `llvm-9` in both:
  - `nghdl-install.sh`
  - `eSim-install.sh`

### üîß Step 2: LLVM Upgrade Attempt
- Noticed that `llvm-9` is **deprecated** in Ubuntu 23.04.
- Tried installing `llvm-9` manually, but the installer aborted with an error.
- Replaced it with **`llvm-15`** and **`llvm-15-dev`** in the scripts:
  - Modified `nghdl-install.sh` to use `llvm-15` (available via APT).
  - Updated `$PATH` and `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to the new LLVM setup.

### üîÅ Step 3: GHDL Upgrade
- Old GHDL version in eSim used LLVM-9 backend.
- Cloned and built **GHDL `6.0.0-dev`** from source using:
  - LLVM-15 backend
  - GNAT 10.5.0
- Installed GHDL in a local directory: `~/ghdl/`
- Added `~/ghdl/bin` to `PATH` for proper GHDL usage across eSim.

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Verilator Upgrade
- Updated Verilator to a newer version (manually built) to match latest simulation requirements.
- Ensured Verilator was installed system-wide and available in `PATH`.

### ü™õ Step 5: Script Fixes
- **`nghdl-install.sh`:**
  - Replaced LLVM-9 dependencies with LLVM-15.
  - Adjusted paths to use custom GHDL.
  - Verified NGHDL builds without issues.

- **`eSim-install.sh`:**
  - Attempted to remove LLVM-9 dependency here as well.
  - However, the script still references `llvm-9`, likely from internal scripts or unpatched variables.
  - Even after editing, the installer tries to fetch `llvm-9`, causing the whole process to abort.
  - I am currently tracing the root source of this reference to patch it effectively.

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Testing and Verification
- After script changes:
  - Successfully compiled NGHDL.
  - Verified GHDL works using LLVM-15.
  - eSim GUI opens and runs.
  - Basic VHDL simulations tested and validated.
  - Custom GHDL and Verilator versions integrated into the eSim ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Environment:
| Tool            | Version                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Ubuntu**      | 23.04 (Lunar Lobster)    |
| **GHDL**        | 6.0.0-dev (LLVM backend) |
| **LLVM**        | 15                       |
| **GNAT**        | 10.5.0                   |
| **Verilator**   | Latest (from source)     |
| **NGHDL**       | Patched from source      |
| **eSim**        | 2.4                      |

## üß™ Testing Results:
| Component       | Status      | Notes                                           |
|------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| GHDL 6.0.0-dev   | ‚úÖ Working   | Built using LLVM 15 backend                      |
| NGHDL            | ‚úÖ Working   | Installed successfully with updated LLVM paths  |
| eSim GUI         | ‚úÖ Working   | Opens and simulates with NGHDL backend          |
| Simulations      | ‚úÖ Verified  | Ran basic circuits to ensure full functionality |

## üìÇ Modified Files:
- `nghdl-install.sh`
- (Partially) `eSim-install.sh` ‚Äì further work needed to patch LLVM-9 dependency completely

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitation:
- Even after replacing `llvm-9` with `llvm-15`, the `eSim-install.sh` script **still references `llvm-9`** from an unknown location.
- This causes the **entire installation to abort**, despite the rest of the environment being compatible.
- Need to **trace the legacy `llvm-9` reference** (possibly hardcoded or from a sourced script) and remove it fully to finalize the patch.
