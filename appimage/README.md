A comprehensive, automated build system for creating a **Universal AppImage** of [eSim](https://esim.fossee.in/) — an open-source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis, and PCB design developed by the [FOSSEE](https://fossee.in/) initiative at IIT Bombay.

This project solves the "dependency hell" problem on Linux by bundling eSim and all its complex requirements into a **single, portable executable** that works across virtually all modern Linux distributions — no installation required.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **True Multi-Distro Compatibility** — Automatically detects and handles dependencies for:
  - **Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Mint** (`apt`)
  - **Fedora / RHEL / CentOS** (`dnf` / `yum`)
  - **Arch Linux / Manjaro** (`pacman`)
  - **openSUSE** (`zypper`)

- **Bundled Tool Suite**:
  - **eSim 2.5** — Latest stable EDA suite with schematic capture, simulation, and PCB design
  - **KiCad 6.0.11** — Bundled via AppImage for perfect compatibility and isolation
  - **NgSpice 35** — Custom-built from source with specialized patches for NGHDL/GHDL integration, clean termination, and Arch compatibility
  - **OpenModelica / OMEdit** — Modelica-based modeling and simulation environment
  - **GHDL** — Open-source VHDL simulator for NGHDL digital models
  - **Verilator** — Fast Verilog HDL simulator for NgVeri integration
  - **Makerchip** — Built-in support for Makerchip IDE integration

- **Zero Configuration** — Automatically sets up Python virtual environments, GTK resources, library paths, and runtime dependencies inside the AppImage

- **Cross-Distribution Library Bundling** — Intelligent fallback system that downloads Ubuntu `.deb` packages for libraries not available on non-Ubuntu systems (OpenSceneGraph, Qt5WebKit, ICU, omniORB)

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the builder, ensure you have:

1. **A Linux machine** (x86_64 architecture)
2. **Sudo privileges** (for installing build tools like `gcc`, `wget`, `python3`, etc.)
3. **Internet connection** — The script downloads several hundred MB of sources and tools
4. **Disk space** — At least **5 GB** of free space for the build process
5. **Basic build tools** — The script will install anything missing, but having `git`, `gcc`, and `wget` pre-installed speeds things up

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

Creating your universal AppImage is as simple as running one command:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahakgupta0123/eSim_Universal_packagemanager_linux.git
cd eSim_Universal_packagemanager_linux
```

### 2. Make the Script Executable
```bash
chmod +x build-appimage.sh
```

### 3. Run the Builder
```bash
./build-appimage.sh
```

The script proceeds through **10 automated stages**:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Distribution detection & system checks |
| 2 | Prerequisite & dependency installation |
| 3 | Tool downloading (KiCad AppImage, OpenModelica, etc.) |
| 4 | eSim source preparation & patching |
| 5 | NgSpice compilation from source (with GHDL patches) |
| 6 | Verilator setup & compilation |
| 7 | Python environment & package installation |
| 8 | GTK resource bundling (icons, themes, schemas) |
| 9 | KiCad & OMEdit library bundling |
| 10 | AppImage creation & packaging |

---

## 🖥️ Usage

Once the build is complete, you will find `eSim-2.5.AppImage` (~625 MB) in the `build-eSim-AppImage/` directory.

### Running the AppImage
```bash
./build-eSim-AppImage/eSim-2.5.AppImage
```

> [!TIP]
> You can copy this single file to **any other Linux distribution** and it will run without needing to install eSim's complex dependency tree!

### What's Included
When you launch the AppImage, you get access to:
- **eSim** — Main schematic/simulation GUI
- **KiCad** — Schematic & PCB editor (launched from within eSim)
- **OMEdit** — OpenModelica editor for Modelica models
- **NgSpice** — Circuit simulation engine (runs automatically from eSim)
- **NGHDL** — VHDL digital model integration
- **NgVeri** — Verilog digital model integration via Verilator

## 🐧 Supported Distributions

| Distribution | Package Manager | Status |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Ubuntu 20.04+ | `apt` | ✅ Fully tested |
| Debian 11+ | `apt` | ✅ Fully tested |
| Linux Mint 21+ | `apt` | ✅ Fully tested |
| Fedora 38+ | `dnf` | ✅ Fully tested |
| Arch Linux | `pacman` | ✅ Fully tested |
| Manjaro | `pacman` | ✅ Fully tested |
| openSUSE Leap/Tumbleweed | `zypper` | ✅ Supported |
| RHEL / CentOS 8+ | `dnf` / `yum` | ✅ Supported |

> [!NOTE]
> The **build** can be performed on any supported distribution. The resulting AppImage is portable and can **run** on any x86_64 Linux distribution with FUSE support.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### FUSE Error (Ubuntu 22.04+)
If the AppImage fails to run with a message about FUSE:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install libfuse2
```

### OMEdit Not Opening
If OMEdit fails to launch, it's usually a missing Qt5 library. The builder automatically handles this by:
- Bundling Ubuntu `.deb` libraries for OpenSceneGraph, Qt5WebKit, ICU, and omniORB
- Installing native Qt5 modules (`qt5-declarative`, `qt5-sensors`, `qt5-location`) during the build

To manually check: run `ldd eSim.AppDir/usr/bin/OMEdit.bin | grep "not found"` inside the build directory.

### Python Import Errors
If you see `ModuleNotFoundError` for PyQt5 or other Python packages:
- On **Arch**: Ensure `python-pyqt5` is installed (`sudo pacman -S python-pyqt5`)
- On **Fedora**: Ensure `python3-PyQt5` is installed (`sudo dnf install python3-PyQt5`)

### Build Failures
Common causes:
- **Interrupted internet** during large downloads (KiCad AppImage is ~600 MB)
- **Missing disk space** (at least 5 GB required)
- **Unsupported architecture** (only x86_64 is currently supported)

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

The build system uses a **layered approach** to handle cross-distribution compatibility:

1. **Detection Layer** — Identifies the host distro and package manager
2. **Dependency Layer** — Installs build-time and runtime dependencies using the native package manager
3. **Compilation Layer** — Builds NgSpice from source with custom patches; compiles Verilator object files
4. **Bundling Layer** — Copies all binaries, libraries, Python packages, GTK resources, and KiCad into the AppDir
5. **Fallback Layer** — For libraries not available on the host system (e.g., OMEdit's Ubuntu-specific dependencies), downloads `.deb` packages from Ubuntu archives and extracts the needed `.so` files
6. **Packaging Layer** — Creates the final AppImage using `appimagetool`
