    1.  eSim installation via Flatpak (All Linux distributions - RECOMMENDED)
   
    2.  eSim installation in Ubuntu OS (LINUX)
   
    3.  eSim installation in Microsoft Windows OS


1.  eSim installation via Flatpak (Fedora, Ubuntu, openSUSE, Arch, etc.)

    The Flatpak method works on all major Linux distributions including
    Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, Arch Linux, and others.

    i.      Install Flatpak if not already installed:
    
            On Fedora:      $ sudo dnf install flatpak
            On Ubuntu:      $ sudo apt install flatpak
            On openSUSE:    $ sudo zypper install flatpak
            On Arch:        $ sudo pacman -S flatpak
    
    ii.     Add the Flathub repository (if not already added):
    
            $ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
    
    iii.    Install eSim:
    
            When available on Flathub:
            $ flatpak install flathub org.fossee.eSim
    
            Or build from source:
            $ cd eSim
            $ flatpak-builder build flatpak/org.fossee.eSim.yml --install --user
    
    iv.     (Optional) Install KiCad for schematic editing:
    
            $ flatpak install flathub org.kicad.KiCad
    
    v.      Run eSim:
    
            $ flatpak run org.fossee.eSim
    
            Or launch from your application menu.

    Flatpak limitations:
    --------------------
    - NGHDL and Makerchip are not included. For full NGHDL/Modelica support,
      use the Ubuntu native installer.
    - SKY130 PDK is not bundled. Use the Ubuntu installer for mixed-signal
      design with SKY130.
    - xterm and gaw are not included; external waveform viewer features may
      require xterm installed on the host system.
    - NGHDL KiCad symbol creation (createkicad) may not work fully due to
      sandbox restrictions on writing to KiCad's symbol directory.


2.  eSim installation in Ubuntu OS
    
   	i.      After downloading eSim, extract it using: 
  
   		       $ unzip eSim-2.5.zip

   	ii.     Now change directories in to the top-level eSim directory (where this INSTALL file can be found).

   	iii.    To install eSim and other dependencies, run the following command :

   		       $ chmod +x install-eSim.sh
   		       $ ./install-eSim.sh --install

   	iv.     To uninstall eSim and all of its components, run the following command :

   		       $ ./install-eSim.sh --uninstall


   How to Run eSim
   =================
   
    A.  Through Terminal
   		
   		   $ esim

    B.  Double click eSim desktop icon


3.  eSim installation in Windows OS

     i.     Download eSim for Windows OS from "https://esim.fossee.in/". Disable the antivirus (if any).

     ii.    If MinGW and/or MSYS is already installed in your machine, then remove it from the
            PATH environment variable as it may interfere with eSim and might not work as intended.

    iii.    Now double click on eSim installer and then follow the instruction to install eSim.

     iv.    Hence the installation is completed.

      v.    To uninstall eSim and all of its components, run the uninstaller "uninst-eSim.exe" located at 
            top-level eSim directory (where this INSTALL file can be found).
