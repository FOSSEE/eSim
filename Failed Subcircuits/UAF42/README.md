# UAF42 Universal Active Filter IC

Universal Active Filter is a general purpose 14-Pin IC. It's basically a universal active filter which can be used as a to high pass filter, low-Pass Filter and Band-Pass Filter.

## Usage/Examples

It is used as Bi-Quad Filters in Sound Systems.

It is also used as High-Pass Filter.

It is also used as Low-Pass Filter.

It is also used as Band-Pass Filter.


## Documentation

To know the details of UAF42 Universal Active Filter IC please refer to this link [UAF42_datasheet.](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/uaf42.pdf?ts=1669904794544&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Fproduct%252FUAF42)


## Error Observed

The circuit is not completely maked because as when it's IC was successfully completed then, the circuit is not able to work as high-Pass Filter as it's one of the application so, The circuit was breaked into chunks and starts implementing Again . So, that it should successfully give the desirable waveform.

## Possible Solution

The designer is suggested to perform the analysis as well as testing of each different block seperately first of the circuit or if in case it is needed, a block level of the IC should have to be redesigned in order to obtain the desired results.
