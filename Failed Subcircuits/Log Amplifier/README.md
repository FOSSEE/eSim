# LOG104 Log Amplifier IC

Log Amplifier is a general purpose 8-Pin IC. It's basically a precision logarithmic and log ratio amplifier . It is the circuit that is used to calculate Logarithm or log ratio of the input current values with respect to the reference current.

## Usage/Examples

It is used to perform mathematical operations like exponentiation,multiplication and division.

It is used as a True RMS Converter.

It is used in the communications, analytical and medical industries.

It is also used for absorbance and optical density measurement.

It is used as a photodiode signal compression ampplifier

It is used also for analog signal compression in front of analog-to-digital (A/D) converters.
## Documentation

To know the details of LOG104 IC please refer to this link [LOG104_datasheet.](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/log104.pdf?ts=1669552722002&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F)

## Error Observed

The output waveform is not coming correct at the time of simulation according to the mathematical calculations.

## Possible Solution

The designer is suggested to perform the analysis as well as testing of each different block seperately first of the circuit or if in case it is needed, a block level of the IC should have to be redesigned in order to obtain the desired results.
